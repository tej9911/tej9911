## Projects

### 1. **Patient Data Healthcare Analysis**
   - **Tech**: Python, Keras
   - **Description**: This project focuses on analyzing patient healthcare data using machine learning techniques. It uses a **Keras model** for predictive analysis, helping to identify patterns and predict patient conditions based on historical data. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation to ensure accurate predictions.

### 2. **Diabetic Retinopathy Prediction**
   - **Tech**: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
   - **Description**: This web-based application helps in predicting **diabetic retinopathy** from medical image data. The backend is powered by **Python**, using machine learning models for analysis, while the frontend is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to provide an intuitive user interface. It aims to assist medical professionals in early diagnosis by analyzing retinal images.

### 3. **Password Generator and Strength Checker**
   - **Tech**: JDBC
   - **Description**: This project involves creating a **password generator** with varying levels of strength and checking password security against common vulnerabilities. Built using **JDBC**, it connects to a database to store password policies, check for common patterns, and provide feedback on how to improve password strength.

### 4. **Bus Ticket Booking System**
   - **Tech**: Python, HTML, CSS
   - **Description**: This system allows users to book bus tickets online. It features an easy-to-use interface built with **HTML** and **CSS**, with the backend powered by **Python** to manage seat reservations, payment processing, and booking history.
