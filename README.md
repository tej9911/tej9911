Hi there! 👋 I'm an undergraduate student with a passion for coding and problem-solving. I specialize in **C**, **C++**, **Java**, and **Python**. I have a strong foundation in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. Below you'll find some highlights of my skills and projects.  

## Skills  

- **Languages**: C, C++, Java, Python  
- **Technologies**: Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, VS Code  
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and more!  
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction  
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter, Colab  

## Projects  

### 1. **Patient Data Healthcare Analysis**  
   - **Tech**: Python, Keras  
   - **Description**: This project focuses on analyzing patient healthcare data using machine learning techniques. It uses a **Keras model** for predictive analysis, helping to identify patterns and predict patient conditions based on historical data. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation to ensure accurate predictions.  

### 2. **Diabetic Retinopathy Prediction**  
   - **Tech**: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
   - **Description**: A cutting-edge web application designed to predict **diabetic retinopathy** by analyzing retinal images. The backend is powered by **Python**, incorporating advanced machine learning models, while the frontend, built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, offers an intuitive interface. The system not only predicts the presence of diabetes but also provides **personalized prescriptions** to assist in patient care.  

### 3. **Password Generator and Strength Checker**  
   - **Tech**: JDBC  
   - **Description**: This project involves creating a **password generator** with varying levels of strength and checking password security against common vulnerabilities. Built using **JDBC**, it connects to a database to store password policies, check for common patterns, and provide feedback on how to improve password strength.  

### 4. **Bus Ticket Booking System**  
   - **Tech**: Python, HTML, CSS  
   - **Description**: This system allows users to book bus tickets online. It features an easy-to-use interface built with **HTML** and **CSS**, with the backend powered by **Python** to manage seat reservations, payment processing, and booking history. It ensures a smooth and secure experience for users while allowing administrators to manage routes and schedules.  

### 5. **Heart Disease Prediction System**  
   - **Tech**: Python, Keras, Logistic Regression, Streamlit
   - **Description**: Developed a machine learning model that predicts the presence of heart disease using various health metrics, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. The system incorporates advanced feature analysis and severity assessment to provide actionable insights. The model is deployed through a Streamlit web app, offering a user-friendly interface for data input and real-time predictions. It also visualizes feature importance and evaluates the risk of heart disease, helping both patients and healthcare professionals make informed decisions.
